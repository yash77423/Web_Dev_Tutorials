1. Block elements: - div, p, h1-h6, form, header, footer, section, etc.
    - displayed in new line
    - take up width of whole page (from extreme left to extreme right), do not depend on content
    - can take up custom widths/heights
    - can take up custom margin/padding

The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.
If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding, and border are included in the width and height.

2. Inline elements: - a, span, etc.
    - try to appear in same line
    - width is taken as per content requirement
    - cannot apply custom width/height
    - only padding and horizontal custom margins can be applied

These elements can be displayed exchangably by specifying display: block/inline;

3. inline-bock:
    - behaves exactly like inline elements
    - but we can set custom width/height
