In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
It consists of: content, padding, borders and margins.

Mardin is applied outside borders (i.e. between two boxes)
Padding is applied inside borders (i.e. b/w border and content)

The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

Example
The CSS rule below will affect every HTML element on the page: 

* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}

The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.
If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding, and border are included in the width and height.
