Block element:
- always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
- always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
- Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
- The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
- The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

Inline element:
- does not start on a new line.
- only takes up as much width as necessary.
- The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.


NOTE: Can you change a block element into an inline element?
If you change the <div> element's display property from block to inline-block, 
the <div> elements will no longer add a line break before and after, 
and will be displayed side by side instead of on top of each other.
